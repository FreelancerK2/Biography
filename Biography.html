                <p><em>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</em></p>
                <p> <b>Sinn Sisamouth</b> (c. 1932 – c. 1976) was a Cambodian singer-songwriter active from the 1950s to
                    the
                    1970s. Widely considered the "King of Khmer Music", Sisamouth, along with Ros Serey Sothea, Pen Ran,
                    Mao Sareth, and other Cambodian artists, was part of a thriving pop music scene in Phnom Penh that
                    blended elements of Khmer traditional music with the sounds of rhythm and blues and rock and roll to
                    develop a Cambodian rock sound. Sisamouth died during the Khmer Rouge regime under circumstances
                    that are unclear. <br />
                <h2 style="font-family:serif">Biography
                    <hr>
                </h2> <b>Early Life</b> <br> Sinn Sisamouth was born in Stung Treng Province, the son of Sinn Leang and
                mother Seb Bunlei. One
                or both of Sisamouth's parents were partially Lao.[1][2] Most sources list his year of birth as
                1935,[3][4] though some list 1932 or 1933.[5][6] 23 August 1933 is generally accepted as his date of
                birth.[7] Some people that had been alive during Sisamouth's era state that he was born during the
                Rooster zodiac, which includes the year 1933. Sisamouth's father was a soldier during the Colonial
                Cambodia period and also served as prison warden in Battambang Province. His father died when he was a
                child and his mother then remarried.[3]

                Sisamouth learned to play stringed instruments at the age of six or seven, and showed a natural singing
                talent. He was often invited to perform music at school functions. At about age 16 he graduated from
                primary school and moved to Phnom Penh to study medicine; this plan was apparently meant to please his
                parents when his true goal was to become a musician.[3] He began composing his own songs around this
                time.[3]

                Sisamouth graduated from medical school around the time that Cambodia gained independence from France in
                1953. He initially worked in a Phnom Penh hospital as a nurse,[8] but was soon hired by the Cambodian
                national radio station as a singer with its band.[3] Around this time, Sisamouth married his cousin Keo
                Thorng Gnu in an arranged marriage, and they eventually had four children.[1][2]</p>

                    a
                    Cambodian singer. She was active during the final years of the First Kingdom of Cambodia and into
                    the Khmer Republic period. She sang in a variety of genres; romantic ballads emerged as her most
                    popular works. Despite a relatively brief career she is credited with singing hundreds of songs. She
                    also ventured into acting, starring in a few films. Details of her life are relatively scarce. She
                    disappeared during the Khmer Rouge regime of the late 1970s but the circumstances of her fate remain
                    a mystery. Norodom Sihanouk granted Sothea the honorary title "Queen with the Golden Voice."[1]

                </h2> <b>Early Life</b> <br> Ros Sothea was born in circa 1948 to Ros Bun (Khmer: រស់ ប៊ុន) and Nath
                Samien (Khmer: ណាត់ សាមៀន) in Battambang province, French protectorate of Cambodia.[2] Growing up
                relatively poor on a farm, Ros Sothea was the second youngest of five children; her older sister Ros
                Saboeut later became known as an activist.[1] She displayed vocal talent as a toddler and grew up
                listening to early Cambodian pop singers like Mao Sareth and Chhoun Malay. Sothea's talent would remain
                relatively hidden until friends persuaded her to join a regional singing contest in 1963. After winning
                the contest she became widely known in her home province and was invited to join a musical troupe that
                regularly performed at Stung Khiev restaurant in Battambang; she also performed in a family band with
                her brother Serey.[3] It is believed that Im Song Seurm, a singer from the National Radio service, heard
                of Sothea's talents and invited her to Phnom Penh in 1967.[4]</p>

                <p> <b>Pen Ron</b> (Khmer: ប៉ែន រ៉ន, Khmer pronunciation: [paen rɑːn]), (c. 1944 – c. 1979) also
                    commonly known
                    as Pan Ron in some Romanized sources intended for English-speaking audiences, was a Cambodian singer
                    and songwriter who was at the height of her popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s. Known
                    particularly for her western rock and soul influences, flirtatious dancing, and risque lyrics,[1]
                    Pen Ran has been described by the New York Times as a "worldly, wise-cracking foil" to the more
                    restrained Cambodian pop singers of her era.[2] She disappeared during the Khmer Rouge genocide and
                    her fate is unknown. <br />
                <h2 style="font-family:serif">Life and Career
                    <hr>
                </h2> Very little is known of Pen Ran's personal history. It has been established that she was from
                Battambang in northwestern Cambodia and attended the same school as the younger Ros Serey Sothea,
                another popular singer of the same era. Pen Ran had a sister named Pen Ram (sometimes Romanized as Pan
                Rom) who was also a singer in the later years of the Cambodian psychedelic rock scene.[3][4]

                Len Somnang, [15/12/24 14:57 ]
                In the 1960s, Cambodian Head of State Norodom Sihanouk, a musician himself, encouraged the development
                of popular music in Cambodia. Initially, pop records from France and Latin America were imported into
                the country and became popular, inspiring a flourishing pop music scene based in Phnom Penh and led by
                singers like Sinn Sisamouth.[2][5] Pen Ran was an early entrant in this music scene, with the hit song
                "Pka Kabas" in 1963,[6] but she became a national star when she began recording with Sinn Sisamouth in
                1966.[3][4] Starting in the late 1960s Ran recorded many collaborations with Sisamouth and other notable
                Cambodian singers of the period,[7] while continuing her solo career. The debut of the popular Ros Serey
                Sothea in 1967 had little effect on Pen Ran's career and perhaps even broadened her popularity as the
                second leading lady of Cambodian popular music.[8]</p>

                <p> <b>Keo Sarath</b> (born Tek Chhom; March 10, 1956 – September 5, 1991) was a Cambodian singer who
                    expressed
                    the trauma of the Khmer people in the wake of the Khmer Rouge terror regime and subsequent invasion
                    of Cambodia by Vietnam. <br />
                <h2 style="font-family:serif">Biography
                    <hr>
                </h2> Keo Sarath was born on March 10, 1956, in Wat Kampheng Village, Srong Battambang District,
                Battambang Province.

                After escaping alive from the bloody Khmer Rouge regime, he lived in a refugee camp on the Khmer-Thai
                border of Khao-I-Dang[1] where he began his musical career and married with his first wife. While their
                newborn just had been born she left for another man, which broke the heart of Keo Sarath. He then sought
                asylum and traveled on his own to the United States, to Boston. He married another Khmer woman named
                Chan Thou. They had 3 more children.[2]

                Len Somnang, [15/12/24 14:57 ]
                After the death under the Khmer Rouge of Sinn Sisamouth which was seen as an irreplaceable loss for
                Khmer singing, Keo Sarath was one of the first popular singers to arouse such enthusiasm, along with
                female singer Song Senhorn.[3] He was nicknamed the "Tiger Jaw Emperor" and was a living artist with
                whom new generations could compare.[4]

                He struggled through the cruel Khmer-Rouge regime. After escaping he lived in the border of Thailand and
                then got married with his first wife.While their newborn just had been born she left for another man.
                Doing so, left Mr. Sarath full of sadness and abandoned with his child.

                He later went back to visit his birthplace and home, Cambodia. While visiting, he was fascinated by the
                new atmosphere and surroundings as the country returned to peace and monarchy.

                Keo Sarath died on September 5, 1991, in Long Beach, California, at the age of 35 from Hepatitis B,
                which he has contracted in the camps.</p>

                <h1>Kong Nay</h1>
                <hr>
                <p><em>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</em></p>
                <p> <b>Kong Nay </b>(Khmer: គង់ ណៃ), also known as Kong Nai (15 March 1944 – 28 June 2024), was a
                    Cambodian
                    musician from Kampot Province in southwestern Cambodia who played a traditional long-necked fretted
                    plucked lute called chapei dang veng.

                    Commonly referred to as Master Kong Nay, he was a master of the chrieng chapei genre (Khmer:
                    ច្រៀង​ចាប៉ី), in which a solo vocalist performs semi-improvised topical material within traditional
                    epics self-accompanied with the chapei.[1]

                    He was one of relatively few great masters to have survived the Khmer Rouge era, and was known as
                    the "Ray Charles of Cambodia".[2] Though his music was very different to Charles, the similarity
                    they hold is that Kong Nay was also blind. The fact that most of the remaining chapei masters, such
                    as Prach Chhoun and Neth Pe, are blind was a rather remarkable coincidence.[3]

                    Len Somnang, [15/12/24 14:57 ]
                    He received the 2017 Fukuoka Arts and Culture Prize.[4][5] <br />

                    <hr>
                </h2> <b>Early Life</b> <br> Kong grew up in a poor family in Daung village, in Kampong Trach district's
                Svay Tong Khang Choeung commune, Kampot province. At the age of four, he contracted smallpox resulting
                in his blindness.[6] Drawn to the sound of the chapei players in his village, he mimicked the sound of
                the instrument until his father was able to purchase a used instrument. Learning from his great uncle
                Kong Kith,[7] Kong Nay became proficient quickly. By 18, he was playing professionally and married Tat
                Chhan.[8]

                </h2> After winning a national chapei competition in 1991, the Ministry of Culture gave him a monthly
                salary of $19 and some land in Phnom Penh's Dey Krahom area,[9] near the White Building in Tonle Bassac.
                <h2 style="font-family:serif">Death
                    <hr>
                </h2>In May 2022, Kong was hospitalised for treatment for high blood pressure, diabetes and lung
                problems at Kampot provincial hospital. Kong's son, Samphors, was quoted as saying his father may not
                play the chapei again.[10]

                On 28 June 2024, Kong died at his home in Kampong Trach District in Kampot province. He was 80.[11]
